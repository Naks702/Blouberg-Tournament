                <h2>Our History</h2>
                 <p>The Blouberg Annual Tournament was born in January 2025 with the successful hosting of our inaugural event. Recognising the positive impact it had on the community, local leaders unanimously agreed to transform this initiative into a monthly tournament.
                     Since then, our mission has been to bring people together, celebrate local talent, 
                     and provide a platform for the youth to shine.</p>
